# severe convective environments study

## goal of the study

* Understand changes to severe convective environments in Europe under twenty-first century warming scenarioes downscaled using high-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs)
* Utilize the Euro-11 CORDEX ensemble of RCMs for this purpose which would be the largest and highest-resolution ensemble used to study severe convective environments to date

## how to participate

### required RCM data

* experiment ids: `historical`, `RCP2.6`, and/or `RCP8.5`. 
* timeslices:
  * historical (1981-2010), 
  * mid-future (2041-2070), 
  * far-future (2071-2100). 
* required pressure levels for `ta` and `qa`: (925,850,700,600,500,400,300,200) hPa.
